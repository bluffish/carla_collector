# CARLA Collector

**A project that easily synthesizes autonomous driving datasets**. Uses the driving simulator, [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla).
    
**Features**
 * Gathers multi-modal sensor data from surrounding cameras, LiDAR, and radar. 
 * Gathers labels such as the position of 3D objects, ground-truth segmentation and depth, and a BEV map.
 * Several maps, models of vehicles, and weather conditions
 * Inbuilt episode control system

**Used to gather a dataset for papers** 
 * Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification for Birdâ€™s Eye View Semantic Segmentation
 * Uncertainty-Focused Semantic Segmentation in BEV for Autonomous Systems: Methods and Benchmarks
