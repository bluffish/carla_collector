**Features**
 * Gathers multi-modal sensor data from surrounding cameras, LiDAR, and radar. 
 * Gathers labels such as the position of 3D objects, ground-truth segmentation and depth, and a BEV map.
 * Several maps, models of vehicles, and weather conditions
 * Inbuilt episode control system

**Used to gather a dataset for papers** 
 * _Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification for Birdâ€™s Eye View Semantic Segmentation_ (Yang et al)
 * _Uncertainty-Focused Semantic Segmentation in BEV for Autonomous Systems: Methods and Benchmarks_ (Lin et al)
